# Midcourse JS Checkpoint ✅

Congratulations on completing the first half of SEI! 🎉 🥂

Before we move onto backend development and NodeJS, let's make sure our JavaScript essentials are in excellent shape after our React Unit.

## Set Up

1. Fork and clone this directory to your sandbox. Checkout a dev branch.
1. Run `npm i` within the directory to install necessary dependencies.
1. Open this repo in your text editor with your `code` command.
1. Run `node filename.js` to see the output of any console.logs as you code in specific files.
1. Run `npm test` to see if your code passes the tests and the outputs of any failing tests.

## Instructions

- Write the JavaScript necessary to complete each prompt.
- Your goal is to get as many tests as possible to pass! ⏲️
- Use the `var` keyword for all variable declarations (for testing purposes only).
- Do not modify the files in the `/test/` folder.

Unless otherwise stated, homework is due the next class day at 10 am ET. 

### Suggested Order

1. Accessing and manipulating "X-Files"-themed data in complex objects and arrays in `objects.js` 👽
